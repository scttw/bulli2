# SilverStripe MultiValueField module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-multivaluefield.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-multivaluefield)

Note: The SilverStripe 2.4 compatible version of the module is still available
in the ss24 branch

A database field type that allows the storage of multiple discrete values in
a single database field. This also provides form fields for entering multiple 
values in a simple manner

* MultiValueTextField - displays a text field. When data is entered, another
  text field is displayed directly beneath. Subsequent data entry triggers
  more text fields to appear
* MultiValueDropdownField - displays a dropdown field. When a value is selected
  another dropdown field is displayed. 

Within templates, the field can be iterated over as per a data object set. 
The property $Value is available as a Varchar type, and other typical 
properties such as $FirstLast etc are inherited from ViewableData.

Data is stored in the database in a serialized PHP format. While this is not
ideal for searching purposes, some external indexing engines (eg the Solr 
module) are aware of the field type and will index accordingly. 

## Version info

Version marked as 2.0.x are compatible with SilverStripe 3.1, with 2.0.1 compatible with 3.1.1.

* [SilverStripe 3.0 compatible version](https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-multivaluefield/tree/1.0)
* [SilverStripe 2.4 compatible version](https://github.com/silverstripe-australia/silverstripe-multivaluefield/tree/ss24)


## Basic Usage

As with all DB fields

	private static $db = array(
		'Keywords' 	=> 'MultiValueField',
	);

To make use of the field on the frontend, you can loop over the Items property

```html

<% loop $Keywords.Items %>

<p>$Key $Value</p>

<% end_loop %>

```

In this case, `$Value` is a Varchar object, so you can call all relevant string field methods on it, such as `$Value.Raw`, `$Value.LimitWordCount` etc etc.

Note that to have the `$Key` value available as something other than an integer, use the `KeyValueField` field type to populate the field.
